# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

- Started off with semantic markup of the HTML DOM hierarchy.
- The layout has two straightforward versions and I believe can be tackled with Flex.
- Using flex-direction, margin and media query, created the basic layout.
- Assigned colors to the typography, buttton and containers.
- Worked on the font sizes and weights in the mobile view.
- Refactored selector attributes whenever there was a duplication.
- Led to multiple instances of same class but arranged in the order of attributes, I'd say it's not looking like a mess.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Box-shadow transition

### What I learned

- CSS classes when structure beautifully serve a larger purpose than it's intended to.
- Getting the fonts to correct size based on a design is not so straightforward.

### Questions for clarification

- The way CSS file is organized with text element split between layout & font-size, is it over-optimization on some level or is there a recommended way to get the selectors close to each other?
